1) ~ Highscore ~
The game displays the highest score the user has achieved so far.

2) ~ Automatic Break reminder ~
A sort of "parental-control" that activates a reminder to take a break after
every a certain number of consecutive games (that can be configured to any
other number). A window pops up, showing how many games have been played so far
and asking the player if it wants to take a break or not. If the player chooses
to do so, the reminder won't appear again. If he decided not to, the window
would pop up after the same amount of games again, until he (hopefully) does :)

3) ~ 'Retro' responsive buttons designed by us*  ~
In order to keep our design  minimalistic, we only designed two buttons -
The first 'multi-purpose' button switches between starting the game, restarting
, and mid-game state automatically. The second button is a responsive 8-bit
"submit" button we designed ourselves using an 8 bit font. Along with the rest
of the layout, we hoped to achieve an 'arcade' nostalgic feeling to the game.
